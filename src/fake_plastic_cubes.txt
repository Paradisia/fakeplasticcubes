fake plastic cubes
a random compo-filling 9K intro in Javascript by Gasman

Instructions:
Run index.html in a browser that isn't Internet Explorer.

You might need to run it via an actual HTTP web server, rather than
just opening the file though...
I'll stick it up at http://fakeplasticcubes.demozoo.org/ at some point.


Thanks to:

Ben Firshman for the dynamicaudio js/swf wrapper
(which I merrily hacked around with):

Nihilogic and Alex Le for the PNG compression hack:
